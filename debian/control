Description: Near Field Communication (NFC) library
 libnfc is a library for Near Field Communication. It abstracts the
 low-level details of communicating with the devices away behind an
 easy-to-use high-level API.
 It supports most hardware based on the NXP PN531, PN532 or PN533
 controller chips.
 .
 This package contains the runtime library files needed to run software
 using libnfc.
